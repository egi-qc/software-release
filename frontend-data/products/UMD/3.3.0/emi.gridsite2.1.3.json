The verification of these credentials is handled by functions within mod_gridsite and the main GridSite shared library, without the need to patch or rebuild mod_ssl.\n\n       ","releaseDate":"2013-12-13 16:02:12","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":1,"revisionVersion":3,"releaseNotes":"\n\n           This is a hotfix for GridSite, fixing problems in proxy delegation caused by the maximum length of the certificate chain being hard-coded at nine.\n\n           For more details see Extended Release Notes\n\n       ","changeLog":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/releases\/emi-3-monte-bianco\/updates\/-\/asset_publisher\/5Na8\/content\/update-8-05-09-2013-v-3-5-1-1#What_s_new_AN2","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.3.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
