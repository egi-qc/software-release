For the latter user case a command line interface (CLI) is available.","releaseDate":"2015-02-16 16:59:17","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":16,"revisionVersion":4,"releaseNotes":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/releases\/emi-3-monte-bianco\/updates\/-\/asset_publisher\/5Na8\/content\/update-21-09-10-2014-v-3-12-0-1#BDII_core_v_1_6_1","changeLog":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/releases\/emi-3-monte-bianco\/updates\/-\/asset_publisher\/5Na8\/content\/update-21-09-10-2014-v-3-12-0-1#BDII_core_v_1_6_1","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.11.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
