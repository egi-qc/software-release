CREAM accepts job submission requests (which are described with the same JDL language used to describe the jobs submitted to the Workload Management System) and other job management requests (e.g. job cancellation, job monitoring, etc). CREAM can be used by the Workload Management System (WMS), via the ICE service, or by a generic client, e.g. an end-user willing to directly submit jobs to a CREAM CE. For the latter user case a command line interface (CLI) is available. \n","releaseDate":"2015-02-16 16:59:17","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":3,"revisionVersion":2,"releaseNotes":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/releases\/emi-3-monte-bianco\/updates\/-\/asset_publisher\/5Na8\/content\/update-23-16-12-2014-v-3-14-0-1#CREAM_GE_module_v_2_3_1","changeLog":"http:\/\/ge-utils.github.io\/emi-cream-ge-v231.html","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.11.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
