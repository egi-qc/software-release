In order to achieve this consistency a number of points must be addressed. First, it must be possible to author and maintain consistent authorization policies. This is handled by the Policy Administration Point (PAP) component in the service. Second, authored policies must be evaluated in a consistent manner, a task performed by the Policy Decision Point (PDP). Finally, the data provided for evaluation against policies must be consistent (in form and definition) and this is done by the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP).
