In effect MySQL is supported out of the box and support for other RDBMSes can be added with a minimal effort.\n\nXUUDB was updated to use a common configuration subsystem of UNICORE. This provides, among others: strict type checking of values, recognition of unknown (misspelled) properties and improved logging.\n\nConfiguration file syntax was changed.\n\nProduct uses common UNICORE libraries for authentication and HTTP server setup. Therefore it supports the same options as all other UNICORE 6.6 for configuring truststores, credentials and HTTP server. Among others directory truststore, openssl-like truststore and PEM credentials are supported.\n\nDocumentation was greatly extended and improved.","changeLog":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/releases\/emi-3-montebianco\/products\/-\/asset_publisher\/5dKm\/content\/unicore-xuudb-2#RfC","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.1.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
