The TSI is a Perl script (requires Version 5.004 or later). If you must use a previous version of Perl, then you should read and change the first few lines of the \"tsi\" file. The TSI performs the work on behalf of UNICORE users and so must be able to execute processes under different uids and gids. Therefore, in production it must be run with sufficient privileges to allow this (during development and test it can be run as a normal user).","releaseDate":"2012-04-02 18:45:54","majorVersion":4,"minorVersion":2,"revisionVersion":0,"releaseNotes":"\n\nWhat's new in 6.4.2\n\n===================\n\n - improvement: tsi_df reports back errors\n\n - fix(Torque): set default working directory\n\n - improvement: ACL.pm allows for setting and getting default ACL. Also support \n\n   for recursive ACL operations is added. It is explicitly stated that the \n\n   current implementation will work only with the Linux implementation of \n\n   the get\/setfacl commands (SF enhancements #3380959)\n\n - improvement: new XNJS\/TSI API #TSI_UMASK for setting the default umask \n\n   for directories and jobs (SF enhancements #3385750)\n\n - improvement: optionally return queue information in GetStatusListing.pm\n\n - improvement: new XNJS\/TSI API #TSI_PROJECT for specifying the project.\n\n   Project support added for: Torque, Slurm, SGE\n\n - fix: setting \"tsi.fail_on_invalid_gids=false\" did not have the intended effect\n\n - fix: use \"vmem\" on Torque (SF bug #2885645)\n\n - added scp-wrapper.pl and scp-wrapper.sh (TCL) helper scripts for scp data staging\n\n - improvement: LL Submit.pm passes reservation reference (SF patch #3427717)\n\n\n\nUpgrade\/deployment notes\n\n========================\n\nNo special notes on clean deployment.\n\n\n\nUpgrading: the rpm does yet support upgrading. We recommend making a backup of the \/etc\/unicore\/tsi\/* files, and installing from scratch, i.e. erasing unicore-tsi first and then\n\nre-installing.\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n============\n\nNone.\n\n                          ","changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.6.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
