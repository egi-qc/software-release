HTML and text files can be edited within a browser window, or pages\n\nand binary files can be uploaded from local disk. Certificate based authentification of users is now far\n\nmore practical with the start of large scale issuing of X.509 certificates within Grid projects.","releaseDate":"2012-04-02 18:45:54","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":7,"revisionVersion":19,"releaseNotes":"\n\nWhat's new:\n\n\n\n    * This is a bugfix release for GridSite, addressing a bug in providing VOMS Role attributes for re-initiated proxies.\n\n\n\nDeployment Notes\n\n\n\n    * To deploy, update your installation and restart the Web-server.\n\n\n\nKnown Issues:\n\n\n\n    * None\n\n\n\n                         ","changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.6.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
