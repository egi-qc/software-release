The package is used to help the user start MPI applications on heterogeneous Grid sites.\n\n\n\nMPI-Start was originally developed in the frame of the int.eu.grid project for the execution of MPI applications with the CrossBroker metascheduler and then extended its use as the official way of starting MPI jobs within EGEE. Currently, it is part of the EMI project.\n\n\n\nThere is a trac page at http:\/\/devel.ifca.es\/mpi-start with information about the development of MPI-Start.
