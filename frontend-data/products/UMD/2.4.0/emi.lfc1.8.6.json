The LFC catalogue provides:\n\n\n\n    Logical File Name (LFN) to Storage URL (SURL) mappings (via a GUID);\n\n    Authorisation on its logical namespace. \n\n\n\nThe LFC relies on a client-server model, using a proprietary socket interface. The LFC server communicates with a database (either Oracle or MySQL), where all the data is stored. The LFC server is accessible on the client side via:\n\n\n\n    A command line interface;\n\n    The C API;\n\n    A Python interface and a Perl interface; \n\n\n\nA read-only distributed catalog can be achieved by using Oracle streams.\n\n\n\nBoth lcg_utils and GFAL support the LFC as a file catalogue.
