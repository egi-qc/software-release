The verification of these credentials is handled by functions within mod_gridsite and the main GridSite shared library, without the need to patch or rebuild mod_ssl","releaseDate":"2014-02-11 15:06:22","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":7,"revisionVersion":29,"releaseNotes":"https:\/\/github.com\/CESNET\/gridsite\/wiki\/Gridsite-release-page#wiki-GridSite_17291","changeLog":"https:\/\/github.com\/CESNET\/gridsite\/wiki\/Gridsite-release-page#wiki-GridSite_17291","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/2","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"2.8.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
