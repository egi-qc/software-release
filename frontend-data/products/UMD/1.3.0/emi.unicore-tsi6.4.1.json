The TSI is a Perl script (requires Version 5.004 or later). If you must use a previous version of Perl, then you should read and change the first few lines of the \"tsi\" file. The TSI performs the work on behalf of UNICORE users and so must be able to execute processes under different uids and gids. Therefore, in production it must be run with sufficient privileges to allow this (during development and test it can be run as a normal user).","releaseDate":"2011-10-31 16:52:37","majorVersion":6,"minorVersion":4,"revisionVersion":1,"releaseNotes":"\n\n                           What's new\n\n\n\nThere are the following fixes:\n\n\n\n    * Submit.pm: handle TSI_STDERR and TSI_STDOUT sent from XNJS for redirecting output and error\n\n    * fix: Torque: GetStatusListing.pm now handles non-word characters in queue name\n\n    * updated the manual \n\n\n\nAnd two enhancements\n\n\n\n    * tsi_ls is returning more information on files: owner, owning group, full UNIX permissions\n\n    * new module ACL.pm for getting\/setting filesystem ACL \n\n\n\nUpgrade\/deployment notes\n\n\n\n    * No special notes on clean deployment.\n\n    * Upgrading: the rpm does yet fully support upgrading.
