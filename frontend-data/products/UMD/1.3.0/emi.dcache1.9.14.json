Jetty 7.4.2 introduced in dCache 1.9.12-6 was the source of a regression in socket error handling.\n\n    * The documentation was updated to better match the FHS compliant version of dCache (GGUS ticket 72686 reported this shortcoming). \n\n\n\nInstallation and configuration:\n\n\n\n    * Just do a yum update and restart dCache. Please see the release notes for incompatibilities with version of dCache before EMI (before 1.9.12-2) \n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\n\n\n    * none \n\n","changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.3.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
