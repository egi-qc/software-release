This Java APIs bug prevented the validation of certificates signed by the TERENA CA.\n\n\n\nInstallation and configuration:\n\n    * The voms and voms-admin services do not rely on the Java APIs and as such do not need any installation\/reconfiguration step\n\n    * Other services using the VOMS Java library fall in one of two cases:\n\n         1. If the service uses the copy of the voms jar installed on the system, than that service should be restarted to take advantage of the fix.\n\n         2. If the service has a copy of the voms jar inside itself, and ignores the copy installed on the system, then that service must be rebuilt\/repackaged to take advantage of the fix.\n\n                          ","changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.3.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
