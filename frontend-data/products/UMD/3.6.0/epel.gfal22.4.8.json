GFAL is interfaced to SRM-compliant back-ends (both v1.1 and v2.2) and storage systems such as Castor, dCache or DPM in which case the relevant protocol is used transparently behind the scenes. Using information published in the information system, it resolves relevant abstract domain data\/file names so that the physical data access as well as the end-points of services are achievable transparently. It allows and unifies access to various types of items such as: LFN, GUID, SURL, SRM and TURL or local path. In addition, some of the crucial, yet common, backend calls are exposed through the library so that users are not limited to POSIX mapping to do specific calls e.g. to reserve space or pin a file. The pluggable architecture of the library permits dynamic change of the versions of some of the supported protocols (i.e. rfio, dCache) without need of redeployment.","releaseDate":"2014-04-07 13:53:10","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":4,"revisionVersion":8,"releaseNotes":"https:\/\/svnweb.cern.ch\/trac\/lcgdm\/attachment\/wiki\/Dpm\/dpm_rpmlist_17032014.txt","changeLog":"https:\/\/svnweb.cern.ch\/trac\/lcgdm\/attachment\/wiki\/Dpm\/dpm_rpmlist_17032014.txt","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.6.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
