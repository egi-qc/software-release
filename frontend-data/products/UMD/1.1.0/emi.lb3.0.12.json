Reconfiguration using YAIM will restart the service automatically.\n\n \n\nKnown Issues:\n\n    * Due to faulty DNS over IPv6 resolution in the c-ares library (v. 1.6.0), L&B does not work in most scenarios involving IPv6-only machines. Upgrade c-ares to 1.7.3 and relaunch yaim to get full IPv6 functionality.\n\n    * Background purge works and return code is handled correctly. It also results in a clean termination of a slave, though, which is currently reported by the master to syslog with priority 'Error' despite being harmless (The actual wording is 'Slave \\d exited with return code 1'). This does not pose a problem, just a false alarm for a person reading the logs.\n\n                          ","changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.1.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
