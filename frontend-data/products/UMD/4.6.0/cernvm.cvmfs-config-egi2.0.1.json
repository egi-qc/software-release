Files and file metadata are aggressively cached and downloaded on demand. Thereby the CernVM-FS decouples the life cycle management of the application software releases from the operating system. CernVM-FS is included in CernVM, however it can also be used outside CernVM.\n","releaseDate":"2017-12-18 12:19:21","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":0,"revisionVersion":1,"releaseNotes":"http:\/\/cvmfs.readthedocs.io\/en\/2.3\/cpt-releasenotes.html","changeLog":"N\/A","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/4","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"4.6.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
