It supports standard Grid access protocols as well as direct access (native POSIX I\/O call) on data, fostering the integration of non Grid aware application providing local access on shared storage. Another important characteristic of StoRM is the capability to identify the physical location of a requested data without querying any database service but evaluating a configuration file, an XML schema that describes the storage namespace and input parameters as the logical identifier and SRM attributes. StoRM relies on the underlying file system structure to identify the physical data position.\n","releaseDate":"2020-11-18 15:10:24","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":11,"revisionVersion":19,"releaseNotes":"http:\/\/italiangrid.github.io\/storm\/2020\/10\/29\/storm-v1.11.19-released.html","changeLog":"StoRM Backend v. 1.11.19\nStoRM WebDAV  v. 1.3.1\n","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/4","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"4.12.3","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
