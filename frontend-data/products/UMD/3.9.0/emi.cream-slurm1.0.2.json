For the latter user case a command line interface (CLI) is available.\n\n","releaseDate":"2014-11-10 16:24:35","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":0,"revisionVersion":2,"releaseNotes":"https:\/\/wiki.italiangrid.it\/twiki\/bin\/view\/CREAM\/SystemAdministratorGuideForEMI3#1_6_4_SLURM","changeLog":"https:\/\/wiki.italiangrid.it\/twiki\/bin\/view\/CREAM\/SystemAdministratorGuideForEMI3#1_6_4_SLURM","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.9.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
