Files and file metadata are aggressively cached and downloaded on demand. Thereby the CernVM-FS decouples the life cycle management of the application software releases from the operating system. CernVM-FS is included in CernVM, however it can also be used outside CernVM.\n","releaseDate":"2014-11-10 16:24:35","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":1,"revisionVersion":19,"releaseNotes":"http:\/\/cernvm.cern.ch\/portal\/cvmfs\/release-2.1","changeLog":"N\/A","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.9.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
