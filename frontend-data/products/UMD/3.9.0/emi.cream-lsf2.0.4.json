For the latter user case a command line interface (CLI) is available.\n\n","releaseDate":"2014-11-10 16:24:35","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":0,"revisionVersion":4,"releaseNotes":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/releases\/emi-3-monte-bianco\/updates\/-\/asset_publisher\/5Na8\/content\/update-18-07-07-2014-v-3-9-0-1#CREAM_LSF_module_v_2_0_4","changeLog":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/releases\/emi-3-monte-bianco\/updates\/-\/asset_publisher\/5Na8\/content\/update-18-07-07-2014-v-3-9-0-1#CREAM_LSF_module_v_2_0_4","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.9.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
