The verification of these credentials is handled by functions within mod_gridsite and the main GridSite shared library, without the need to patch or rebuild mod_ssl.","releaseDate":"2014-06-12 16:28:21","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":2,"revisionVersion":3,"releaseNotes":"https:\/\/github.com\/CESNET\/gridsite\/wiki\/Gridsite-release-page#GridSite_2231","changeLog":"https:\/\/github.com\/CESNET\/gridsite\/wiki\/Gridsite-release-page#GridSite_2231","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.7.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
