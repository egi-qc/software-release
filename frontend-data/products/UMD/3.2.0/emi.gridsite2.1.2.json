The verification of these credentials is handled by functions within mod_gridsite and the main GridSite shared library, without the need to patch or rebuild mod_ssl.","releaseDate":"2013-09-12 17:57:32","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":1,"revisionVersion":2,"releaseNotes":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/releases\/emi-3-monte-bianco\/updates\/-\/asset_publisher\/5Na8\/content\/update-7-05-08-2013-v-3-5-0-1#GridSite_v_2_1_2","changeLog":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/releases\/emi-3-monte-bianco\/updates\/-\/asset_publisher\/5Na8\/content\/update-7-05-08-2013-v-3-5-0-1#GridSite_v_2_1_2","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.2.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
