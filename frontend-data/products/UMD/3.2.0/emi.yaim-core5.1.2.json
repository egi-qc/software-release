The aim of YAIM is to provide simple configuration methods that can be used to set up uniform grid sites but can also be adapted and extended to meet the needs of larger sites. To ensure that local administrators can adapt YAIM, it has been implemented as a set of bash scripts. To support the component based release model within the EGEE project, YAIM has been modularized and a YAIM core is supplemented by component specific scripts distributed as RPMs.","releaseDate":"2013-09-12 17:57:32","majorVersion":5,"minorVersion":1,"revisionVersion":2,"releaseNotes":"config_mkgridmap must prevent standard grid-mapfile on FTS and LFC","changeLog":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/releases\/emi-3-monte-bianco\/updates\/-\/asset_publisher\/5Na8\/content\/update-3-30-04-2013-v-3-2-0-1#List_of_RfC_AN15","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.2.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
