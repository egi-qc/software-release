The verification of these credentials is handled by functions within mod_gridsite and the main GridSite shared library, without the need to patch or rebuild mod_ssl","releaseDate":"2014-02-20 11:17:21","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":2,"revisionVersion":1,"releaseNotes":"https:\/\/github.com\/CESNET\/gridsite\/wiki\/Gridsite-release-page#wiki-GridSite_2211","changeLog":"https:\/\/github.com\/CESNET\/gridsite\/wiki\/Gridsite-release-page#wiki-GridSite_2211","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.5.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
