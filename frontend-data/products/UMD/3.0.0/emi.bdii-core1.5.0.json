They provide detailed information about grid services which is needed for various different tasks. The EMI information system has a hierarchical structure of three levels. The fundamental building block used in this hierarchy is the Berkley Database Information Index (BDII). Although the BDII has additional complexity, it can be visualized as an LDAP database. The resource level BDII is usually co-located with the grid service and provides information about that service. Each grid site runs a site level BDII. This aggregates the information from all the resource level BDIIs running at that site. The top level BDII aggregates all the information from all the site level BDIIs and hence contains information about all grid services. There are multiple instances of the top level BDII in order to provide a fault tolerant, load balanced service. The information system clients query a top level BDII to find the information that they require.","releaseDate":"2013-05-14 17:54:56","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":5,"revisionVersion":0,"releaseNotes":"Optimisations to have faster access to GLUE 2.0 information have been done at LDAP configuration level (indexed attributes and increased cache size)\n\nThe delayed information for the cached top level BDII is now deleted when the BDII is restarted\n\nARC integration: GLUE2GroupName and services have been defined as aliases for GLUE2GroupID and resources. This means any of these attributes and values can be used\n\nThe resource BDII has now an explicit dependency on 2.4 version of Openldap to be able to enable the ARC integration changes.\n\nEMIR integration: new YAIM function config_emir_serp is now available to automatically publish service information into EMIR\n\nService information provider bug fixes and enhancements\n\nRemoved old glite related configuration from glite-yaim-bdii\n\nglue-validator bug fixes: accept 'ldap' and 'voms' as valid protocol in URLs; New features: new test to check on empty attributes, allow GLUE2GroupName new alias and add 'information.publication' as a valid GLUE2EndpointCapability\n\nglue-schema changes requested by ARC. Among them, definition of strings as UTF-8 instead of ASCII\n\nFixes at packaging level to be EPEL compliant\n\nUpdated version of the Sys Admin Guide.","changeLog":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/releases\/emi-3-montebianco\/products\/-\/asset_publisher\/5dKm\/content\/bdii-core-2#RfC","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.0.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
