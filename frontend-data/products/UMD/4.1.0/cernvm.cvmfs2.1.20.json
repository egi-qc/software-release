Files and file metadata are aggressively cached and downloaded on demand. Thereby the CernVM-FS decouples the life cycle management of the application software releases from the operating system. CernVM-FS is included in CernVM, however it can also be used outside CernVM.\n","releaseDate":"2016-05-27 13:37:36","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":1,"revisionVersion":20,"releaseNotes":"http:\/\/cernvm.cern.ch\/portal\/filesystem\/cvmfs-2.1.20","changeLog":"N\/A","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/4","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"4.1.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
