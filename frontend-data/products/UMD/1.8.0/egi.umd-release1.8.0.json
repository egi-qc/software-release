Centos users have to first install the latest epel-release package that can be found at:\nhttp:\/\/download.fedora.redhat.com\/pub\/epel\/5\/i386\/repoview\/epel-release.html\n- OS repositories do NOT provide an package that fulfills the \"jdk\" requirement (found in some UMD products). Due licensing issues this has to be done manual. For more info see:\nhttp:\/\/wiki.centos.org\/HowTos\/JavaOnCentOS\n- Installing the umd-release RPM adds all other repositories that are needed for the installation of UMD products.\n\nScientific Linux CERN: Tested on \"Scientific Linux CERN SLC release 5.6 (Boron)\"\n- This distribution is intended only for people IN CERN. An additional repository \"cernonly\", which is only available in the CERN intranet, has to be enabled to provide a package that fulfills the \"jdk\" requirement. Otherwise Centos guidelines could apply here too.\n- Installing the umd-release RPM adds all other repositories that are needed for the installation of UMD products.","changeLog":"\n\n                          Changed Priority=1 to comply with the documentation available on the repository web site.\n\n                          ","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.8.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
