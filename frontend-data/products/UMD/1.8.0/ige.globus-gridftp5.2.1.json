The 2.1.1 release contains an update of the globus-gridftp-server and globus-gridftp-server-control packages that addresses a security issue that could lead to wrong user mapping in the Globus GridFTP server in the presence of a malformed gridmap-file (Globus Jira GT-195, EGI RT #3765). In addition it introduces a feature to the globus-ftp-client package, previously available in the old VDT Globus distribution, that allows gridftp version 2 to be activated using environment variables (GGUS #81230).","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.8.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
