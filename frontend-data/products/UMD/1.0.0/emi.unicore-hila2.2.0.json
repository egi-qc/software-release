SF Feature 3160069\n\n    * Support for ServiceOrchestrator.\n\n    * Using EHCache instead of an unbounded(!) hash map for Site caching\n\n    * ComputeTask is called Job now for more clarity\n\n    * Recursive import and export\n\n    * Tasks store error conditions for detailed inspection\n\n    * Improved blocking on local tasks\n\n    * Improved file caching\n\n    * Import from and export to streams\n\n    * mkdir creates recursive directory strucures only if explicitly requested, otherwise refuses to create (resembles mkdir -p behavior)\n\n\n\nInstallation and configuration\n\n    * yum install unicore-hila-shel\n\n    * unicore-hila-shell depends on unicore-hila-unicore6, as it is the only implementation of the abstract interface at the moment.\n\n    * After installation, when hila-shell is started for the first time, it will copy a sample configuration using demo certificates into the user's home directory under ~\/.hila2 if no configuration previously exists in that location. The file unicore6.properties in that directory will have to be edited for the infrastructure that is to be used.\n\n\n\nKnown issues\n\n    * None at the time of release.\n\n                          ","changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.0.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
