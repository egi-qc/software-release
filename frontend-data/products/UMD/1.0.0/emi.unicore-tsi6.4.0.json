The TSI is a Perl script (requires Version 5.004 or later). If you must use a previous version of Perl, then you should read and change the first few lines of the \"tsi\" file. The TSI performs the work on behalf of UNICORE users and so must be able to execute processes under different uids and gids. Therefore, in production it must be run with sufficient privileges to allow this (during development and test it can be run as a normal user).","releaseDate":"2011-07-11 20:50:50","majorVersion":6,"minorVersion":4,"revisionVersion":0,"releaseNotes":"\n\n                           What's new\n\n    * The TSI is released as an RPM package\n\n    * It includes a resource reservation module for Maui\/Torque.\n\n\n\nDeployment notes\n\n    * None, this is the first EMI release.\n\n\n\nKnown issues\n\n    * None\n\n                          ","changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.0.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
