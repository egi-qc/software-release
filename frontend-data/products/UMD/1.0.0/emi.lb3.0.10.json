Reconfiguration is required. reconfiguration by YAIM will restart the service automatically.\n\n\n\nThere was major restructuring of dependencies compared to L and B 2.x, caused by conversion to EPEL-based dependencies.\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    * Due to faulty DNS over IPv6 resolution in the c-ares library (v. 1.6.0), L and B does not work in most scenarios involving IPv6-only machines. Upgrade c-ares to 1.7.3 and relaunch yaim to get full IPv6 functionality.\n\n                          ","changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.0.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
