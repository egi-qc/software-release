The daemon maintains\n\na repository of proxy certificates that have been registered by the WMS for renewal. After succesfull\n\nregistration of a proxy, the WMS refers to the repository file whenever it needs access the proxy of a\n\nparticular job. When the finishes the WMS unregisters the proxy from the repository.","releaseDate":"2011-07-11 20:50:50","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":3,"revisionVersion":19,"releaseNotes":"\n\n                          * What's new:\n\n  - Functionality concerned, this release provides the same as ProxyRenewal 1.3.11 released previously with gLite 3.2\n\n\n\n* Deployment\n\nDependencies were restructured due to the conversion to EPEL-based dependencies.
