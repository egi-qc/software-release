These plugins are handled by a\n\nset of higher level classes which thus are the ones to offer the plugin functionality to external calls.

With this release the ng* clients are replaced by the arc* clients.\n\n* Introduction of a modular architecture, which comes to its power in the libarcclient and libarcdata2 libraries.\n\n* Compute client comes with plugins providing functionality for job submission, resubmission, and job management against the pre-WS ARC, A-REX, CREAM and any BES-based Execution Service (ES).\n\n* Compute client supports job migration between A-REX instances.\n\n* Compute client supports resource discovery based on EGIIS, ISIS and BDII index services.\n\n* Compute client offers matchmaking and ranking by shortest queue, clock speed, benchmark or data location.\n\n* Compute client offers job description translation between the XRSL, JSDL and JDL languages.\n\n* Modular libarcclient allows easy extension for additional services, ranking algorithms, or job description languages.\n\n* New plugins-based data library, libarcdata2, replaces previous data library.\n\n* Data access is now managed through DMCs, protocol-specific plugins.\n\n* New data clients (arcls, arccp, arcrm, arcsrmping) replace previous data clients (ngls, ngcp, ngrm, ngtransfer, ngstage, ngacl).\n\n* Improved default output for arcls, now closer to UNIX ls. Options are provided to specify non-default output.\n\n* Improved error messages for arcls and arccp, improved calculation of file checksums.\n\n* Fixed a bug where the check for readability (arcls -c) failed incorrectly in some cases.\n\n* Fixed a bug where metadata from gridftp objects were incorrectly reported.\n\n* arcproxy bugfixes: arcproxy - dteam VO error (#2026), arcproxy does not search \/etc\/vomses recursively (#2118), Segmentation fault with arcproxy with invalid vomses file (#2155)\n\n\n\nDeployment notes:\n\n-----------------\n\n*  With this release the new clients (arc*) utilising the strength of libarcclient and libarcdata2 replace the old clients (ng*).The behaviour and interface of the new clients slightly differs from the old ones, so for compatibility reasons the ng* still distributed as part of the compat package.\n\n* The old arclib is now replaced by the new libraries and tagged as obsolete (though still available).\n\n* Previous clients (ng*) are now available from nordugrid-arc-compat package.\n\n* The new clients (arc*) are available from the nordugrid-arc-client package.\n\n* The libracclient and libarcdata2 libraries are available from the nordugrid-arc package.\n\n* The DMCs and different plugins are available from nordugrid-arc-plugins-needed and nordugrid-arc-plugins-globus (the latter requires globus).\n\n \n\nKnown Issues \n\n-------------\n\n* The new arc* commands are not 100% compatible with the old ng* commands. A detailed analysis of the differences are provided as part of client component documentation.\n\n* Recursive copy using ngcp -r deletes existing files (see nordugrid bug #2132). Use caution when using ngcp -r or use arccp -r instead.\n\n*There are additional non-critical smaller issues registered in NorduGrid bugzilla.\n\n","changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.0.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""}
