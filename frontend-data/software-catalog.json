The fundamental building block used in this hierarchy is the Berkley Database Information Index (BDII). Although the BDII has additional complexity, it can be visualized as an LDAP database. The resource level BDII is usually co-located with the grid service and provides information about that service. Each grid site runs a site level BDII. This aggregates the information from all the resource level BDIIs running at that site. The top level BDII aggregates all the information from all the site level BDIIs and hence contains information about all grid services. There are multiple instances of the top level BDII in order to provide a fault tolerant, load balanced service.

The resource level BDII is usually co-located with the grid service and provides information about that service. Each grid site runs a site level BDII. This aggregates the information from all the resource level BDIIs running at that site. The top level BDII aggregates all the information from all the site level BDIIs and hence contains information about all grid services. There are multiple instances of the top level BDII in order to provide a fault tolerant, load balanced service.

Such systems typically store data on magnetic tapes instead of disks, which must be loaded and unloaded using a tape robot. The main reason for using tertiary storage is the better cost-efficiency, archiving a very large amount of data on rather inexpensive hardware. In turn the access latency for archived data is significantly higher.\n\n\n\ndCache also supports many transfer protocols (allowing users to read and write to data). These have a modular deployment, allowing dCache to support expanded capacity by providing additional front-end machines.\n\n\n\nAnother performance feature of dCache is hot-spot data migration. In this process, dCache will detect when files are requested very often. If this happens, dCache can generate duplicates of the popular files on other computers. This allows the load to be spread across multiple machines, so increasing throughput.\n\n\n\nThe flow of data within dCache can also be carefully controlled. This is especially important for large sites as chaotic movement of data may lead to suboptimal usage. Instead, incoming and outgoing data can be marshaled so they use designated resources guaranteeing better throughput and improving end-user experience.\n\n\n\ndCache provides a comprehensive administrative interface for configuring the dCache instance.

Affected sites will see list full in their log file. Several xrootd related race conditions and protocol violations in the pool have been fixed. Fixed an issue preventing upload through SRM to the root-directory of the name space. Support for running the srm service so that it directly uses a custom kpwd file (independent of the rest of dCache) has been removed. All SRM authentication and authorisation activity must now go through gPlazma. Note that it is possible to configure SRM to use a different gPlazma configuration from the rest of dCache by embedding the gPlazma (see useGPlazmaAuthorizationModule and useGPlazmaAuthorizationCell options). These options, along with gPlazmas kpwd plugin, allow for an equivalent configuration. The srm service now listens on two ports. These are, by default, 8443 (as before) and 8445. Port 8443 continues to be for SRM clients that use GSI-based communication and the new port is for SRM clients that use SSL. While the SSL port is configurable, it is recommended to use the default as this an agreed port-number for SSL-based SRM traffic.\n\n    Resolved a conflict between the httpd service with billing plots enabled and the pin manager. Before those two service could not co-exist in the same dCache domain. Improved SQL standards compliance of replica manager. Fixed database related bugs that would prevent replica manager from operating within acceptable parameters. We now use the loopback interface when talking to rpcbind\/portmap. Now, admins do not need to open portmapper port (111) in the firewalls. For nfs we switch to grizzly 2.2.9 with many improvements and bug fixes including internal IO buffers recycling. In the webadmin we can filter content of CellInfo, Pool Queue and Active Transfers tables. And we fixed 'page expired exception' which used to appear when page was left idle for more than 24 hours. For webdav we fixed a problem in the WebDAV door in which proxied reads would pause 5 to 10 seconds after the transfer. Also fixed an authorization problem in the WebDAV door relating to basic authentication. dCache erroneously replied with '405 method not allowed' when it should have replied '401 unauthorized'. Also resolved a compatibility issue between the dCache WebDAV door and Gnome. The problem prevented dCache WebDAV shares from being mounted in Gnome.\n\n    Gplazma2 supports gplazma1 as a plugin. The default configuration of dCache will work as the gplazma1 is configured. Any existing gplazma1 and gplazma2 configurations will work as before. NOTICE: we have no experience in combining gplazma1 plugin with other gplazma2 plugins.\n\n    Another useful addition are two new commands to the admin interface when looking at the! gPlazma cell. test login replaces the existing get mapping command. It shows the result of a login attempt but is more flexible when describing which principals have been identified for the user. The second is explain login. This command uses the same format as test login but provides detailed information on how the login was processed. The result of each processed plugin is explained in a tree structure.\n\n    For the poolmanager we suggest people regenerate poolmanager.conf after upgrade by running the save command in the pool manager. This will ensure compatibility with future releases.\n\n    Some of dCache properties accept only a few possible values (e.g., either true or false). The parsing of such properties is now more robust and incorrect values will be reported. Previously, incorrect values would take some default value. Now, if a property is configured with a value outside the set of acceptable values then an error is reported and dCache refuses to start. As part of this process, some equivalent property values are no longer considered the same; for example, some properties took true, True and TRUE as values that would result in the same behaviour but now only true is valid. After upgrading, we recommend you run the dcache check-config command to check your configuration.\n\n    dcache service is not enabled by default. Admins have to enable it by hand if required: \/sbin\/chkconfig --add dcache-server\n\n","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/2","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"2.3.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""},{"name":"emi.emi-ui","version":"2.0.1","documentationLinks":["https:\/\/twiki.cern.ch\/twiki\/bin\/view\/EMI\/EMIui"],"target":[],"capabilities":["Client Tools"],"currentState":"deployed","technologyProvider":"European Middleware Initiative","contact":"cristina.aiftimiei@pd.infn.it","technicalContact":"cristina.aiftimiei@pd.infn.it","description":" The emi-ui is a suite of clients and APIs that users and applications can use to access grid services\n\n\n\nThe access point to the Grid-Infrastructure is the User Interface (UI).

This aggregates the information from all the resource level BDIIs running at that site. The top level BDII aggregates all the information from all the site level BDIIs and hence contains information about all grid services.

GFAL is interfaced to SRM-compliant back-ends (both v1.1 and v2.2) and storage systems such as Castor, dCache or DPM in which case the relevant protocol is used transparently behind the scenes. Using information published in the information system, it resolves relevant abstract domain data\/file names so that the physical data access as well as the end-points of services are achievable transparently. It allows and unifies access to various types of items such as: LFN, GUID, SURL, SRM and TURL or local path. In addition, some of the crucial, yet common, backend calls are exposed through the library so that users are not limited to POSIX mapping to do specific calls e.g. to reserve space or pin a file. The pluggable architecture of the library permits dynamic change of the versions of some of the supported protocols (i.e. rfio, dCache) without need of redeployment. \n\nlcg_utils was used to create Grid equivalents of UNIX copy commands and file registration that can span two storage systems and catalogues of choice (i.e. LFC, EDG). Other functions have been implemented, such as getting the list of file replicas from many sources, performing lookups on LFNs or GUIDs, changing the status of the file or finally removing it from the Grid. The choice of commands implemented was user driven and is often on the first frontier for the Grid user or Grid testers. lcg_utils is both the C library and simple command-line programs based on this library. It consists of 16 calls and Unix command line programs wrapping them. \n\n","releaseDate":"2012-05-28 16:41:49","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":12,"revisionVersion":0,"releaseNotes":"\n\nWhat's new\n\n    Main improvement: supporting GLUE 2.

In case of co-location with the L&B, make sure that yaim is run also for the latter.\n\n\n\n    In case of update, before applying the update stop all the services. After the update (after yum update and after yaim configuration):\n\n        set the ownership of the directories \/var and \/var\/log to root.root\n\n        execute the cron job \/etc\/cron.d\/glite-wms-create-host-proxy.cron \n\n    In case of a clean install, after yaim configuration:\n\n        execute the cron job \/etc\/cron.d\/glite-wms-create-host-proxy.cron \n\n\n\n    In the configuration file \/etc\/glite-wms\/glite_wms.conf the following two parametes for the load_monitor must always have the same values, even if different from the default ones: \n\n\n\njobSubmit  = \"${WMS_LOCATION_SBIN}\/glite_wms_wmproxy_load_monitor --oper jobSubmit --load1 22 --load5 20 --load15 18 --memusage 99 --diskusage 95 --fdnum 1000 --jdnum 150000  --ftpconn 300\";\n\njobRegister  =  \"${WMS_LOCATION_SBIN}\/glite_wms_wmproxy_load_monitor --oper jobRegister --load1 22 --load5 20 --load15 18 --memusage 99 --diskusage 95 --fdnum 1000 --jdnum 150000 --ftpconn 300\";\n\n\n\nThe admin guide has been updated with the following information:\n\n    The location of the drain file has changed with respect to the gLite version\n\n    Configuration tips in case colocation with the LB \n\n\n\nCheck out the guide for more details.\n\n\n\nKnown issues\n\nAs said above, this update fixes a problem on ext3 with the proxy purger preventing new delegations for a certain user after her 31999th submission. Even with this fix, there are at any rate some minor issues on ext3:\n\n    a: there can be at most 31999 different users submitting to a certain WMS (very unlikely)\n\n    b: there can be at most 31999 valid (i.e. not expired) proxies for a certain user (the purging of the expired proxy files is done on the WMS by a cron job which runs every 6 hours) \n\n\n\nTo definitely avoid this issues, ext4 is needed. Nonetheless, re-creating new delegations each time without reusing them has to be considered a bad and not supported practice, so that what mentioned here only for the sake of clarity should be actually considered a non-issue more than a known issue.\n\n    In case of WMS+LB colocation, error \"no state in DB\" on glite-wms-job-submit means that the WMS has not been authorized in the L&B authorization file. Refer to the 'Installation and configuration\" section above to fix this issue.\n\n    If there are problems with purging, or the first output retrieval gives \"Warning - JobPurging not allowed (CA certificate verification failed)\", that means that the host proxy certificate has not been installed. Refer to the \"Installation and configuration\" section above to fix this issue. \n\nOn very high loads, kind of submitting 1k\/2k collections of 25 nodes with a frequency of 60 seconds, the following call to the L&B might require a not trivial time (wmproxy.log):\n\n\"WMPEventlogger::registerSubJobs\": Registering DAG subjobs to LB Proxy..\n\nIf this time is long enough to exceed the mod_fcgid IPCCommTimeout parameter, then the request will be terminated with the consequence of leaving the collection pending forever. Other than increasing IPCCommTimeout, check that L&B is properly doing its purging. Especially when in 'both' mode, the admin can act on the purging policy to make it more frequent. In proxy mode, the admin can eventually decide to turn off automatic purging of the jobs in terminal state (-G option of glite-lb-bkserverd).\n\n    The \"job feedback\", a newly introduced feature to replan jobs stuck at blocking queues, is far from being perfect, at this stage.

GFAL is interfaced to SRM-compliant back-ends (both v1.1 and v2.2) and storage systems such as Castor, dCache or DPM in which case the relevant protocol is used transparently behind the scenes. Using information published in the information system, it resolves relevant abstract domain data\/file names so that the physical data access as well as the end-points of services are achievable transparently. It allows and unifies access to various types of items such as: LFN, GUID, SURL, SRM and TURL or local path. In addition, some of the crucial, yet common, backend calls are exposed through the library so that users are not limited to POSIX mapping to do specific calls e.g. to reserve space or pin a file. The pluggable architecture of the library permits dynamic change of the versions of some of the supported protocols (i.e. rfio, dCache) without need of redeployment. \n\nlcg_utils was used to create Grid equivalents of UNIX copy commands and file registration that can span two storage systems and catalogues of choice (i.e. LFC, EDG). Other functions have been implemented, such as getting the list of file replicas from many sources, performing lookups on LFNs or GUIDs, changing the status of the file or finally removing it from the Grid. The choice of commands implemented was user driven and is often on the first frontier for the Grid user or Grid testers. lcg_utils is both the C library and simple command-line programs based on this library. It consists of 16 calls and Unix command line programs wrapping them. \n\n","releaseDate":"2011-12-19 12:08:42","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":11,"revisionVersion":19,"releaseNotes":"\n\nWhat's New:\n\nBugfix release, mainly to fix gSOAP log file generation problem and some regressions after integrating the new shared libraries (is-interface, gridftp-ifce).

Most of the issues fixed are related to packaging and the templates provided by the glite-info-provider-service component.\n\n\n\nOne new useful feature has been included which is an improved status command which detects that the BDII is not updating. The yaim configuration has also been improved so that the BDII will automatically start on reboot. Improve status command to detect hanging BDII.\n\n\n\nVersion 1.7.0 of glite-info-provider-service has the following updates in addtion:\n\n\n\n    * There is a completely new GLUE 2 provider for VOMS. This should be called like:\n\n          o glite-info-glue2-voms glite-info-glue2-voms.conf[,glite-info-glue2-voms-admin.conf] <site-name> \n\n\n\nwhere the voms-admin config file should only be included if voms-admin is running on the server. The relevant config templates are glite-info-glue2-voms.conf.template and glite-info-glue2-voms-admin.conf.template, and it should normally be possible to use them without modification. This provider creates a single GLUE2Service object with one GLUE2Endpoint per VO for each of voms and voms-admin.\n\n\n\n    * For the WMS (wmproxy) the DN is now extracted using openssl rather than grid-cert-info, but there should be no effect on the published information. Also the GLUE 2 publisher will have GLUE2EndpointServingState: draining if a file \/etc\/glite-wms\/.drain exists.\n\n    * The GLUE 2 information for the RTEPublisher (software tag publisher) has been revamped to fit within the ComputingService structure in CREAM. In particular the service type (EndpointInterfaceName) is now org.glite.ce.ApplicationPublisher.\n\n    * There is a new GLUE 2 template for the CEMon, again intended to fit within the ComputingService structure for CREAM.\n\n    * The VOMS, WMS (wmproxy) and CEMon templates and scripts have been updated to reflect the new paths, environment variables, RPM names and documentation locations in EMI, and hence are no longer compatible with gLite installations.\n\n    * A bug in the GLUE 2 publisher has been fixed that prevented the publication of multiple Extension objects with the same Key.\n\n    * The old beta-test GLUE 2 publisher has been renamed and replaced by a script which calls the new publisher, so any service which is still configured to use it will publish in the more up-to-date format.\n\n    * The wrapper around the service status query has been extended to allow extra arguments to be passed to the init.d script. This is used by voms and should otherwise be transparent. \n\n\n\nThis release also include the BDII Nagios probe. This probe is already running in production but has been repackaged for release within EMI.

With this release the ng* clients are replaced by the arc* clients.\n\n* Introduction of a modular architecture, which comes to its power in the libarcclient and libarcdata2 libraries.\n\n* Compute client comes with plugins providing functionality for job submission, resubmission, and job management against the pre-WS ARC, A-REX, CREAM and any BES-based Execution Service (ES).\n\n* Compute client supports job migration between A-REX instances.\n\n* Compute client supports resource discovery based on EGIIS, ISIS and BDII index services.\n\n* Compute client offers matchmaking and ranking by shortest queue, clock speed, benchmark or data location.\n\n* Compute client offers job description translation between the XRSL, JSDL and JDL languages.\n\n* Modular libarcclient allows easy extension for additional services, ranking algorithms, or job description languages.\n\n* New plugins-based data library, libarcdata2, replaces previous data library.\n\n* Data access is now managed through DMCs, protocol-specific plugins.\n\n* New data clients (arcls, arccp, arcrm, arcsrmping) replace previous data clients (ngls, ngcp, ngrm, ngtransfer, ngstage, ngacl).\n\n* Improved default output for arcls, now closer to UNIX ls. Options are provided to specify non-default output.\n\n* Improved error messages for arcls and arccp, improved calculation of file checksums.\n\n* Fixed a bug where the check for readability (arcls -c) failed incorrectly in some cases.\n\n* Fixed a bug where metadata from gridftp objects were incorrectly reported.\n\n* arcproxy bugfixes: arcproxy - dteam VO error (#2026), arcproxy does not search \/etc\/vomses recursively (#2118), Segmentation fault with arcproxy with invalid vomses file (#2155)\n\n\n\nDeployment notes:\n\n-----------------\n\n*  With this release the new clients (arc*) utilising the strength of libarcclient and libarcdata2 replace the old clients (ng*).The behaviour and interface of the new clients slightly differs from the old ones, so for compatibility reasons the ng* still distributed as part of the compat package.\n\n* The old arclib is now replaced by the new libraries and tagged as obsolete (though still available).\n\n* Previous clients (ng*) are now available from nordugrid-arc-compat package.\n\n* The new clients (arc*) are available from the nordugrid-arc-client package.\n\n* The libracclient and libarcdata2 libraries are available from the nordugrid-arc package.\n\n* The DMCs and different plugins are available from nordugrid-arc-plugins-needed and nordugrid-arc-plugins-globus (the latter requires globus).\n\n \n\nKnown Issues \n\n-------------\n\n* The new arc* commands are not 100% compatible with the old ng* commands. A detailed analysis of the differences are provided as part of client component documentation.\n\n* Recursive copy using ngcp -r deletes existing files (see nordugrid bug #2132). Use caution when using ngcp -r or use arccp -r instead.\n\n*There are additional non-critical smaller issues registered in NorduGrid bugzilla.\n\n","changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.0.0","softwareConfigurationLink":""},{"name":"emi.argus-ees","version":"0.0.10","documentationLinks":["http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/kebnekaise-products\/-\/asset_publisher\/4BKc\/content\/argus-ees?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-emi.eu%2Fkebnekaise-products%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_4BKc%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_pos%3D1%26p_p_col_count%3D2"],"target":[{"id":13,"productId":34,"platform":"sl5","arch":"x86_64","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1\/sl5\/x86_64\/base","gpgkey":null,"rpms":[],"apicallback":"http:\/\/admin-repo.egi.eu\/api\/report\/release\/xml?id=2239","status":1}],"capabilities":["Credential Management"],"currentState":"deployed","technologyProvider":"European Middleware Initiative","contact":"cristina.aiftimiei@pd.infn.it","technicalContact":"cristina.aiftimiei@pd.infn.it","description":"The EES is a pluggable, configurable authorisation\n\nservice similar to the Site Central Authorisation Service (SCAS).

The VOMS Admin service is a web application providing tools for administering member databases for VOMS, the Virtual Organization Membership Service. VOMS Admin provides an intuitive web user interface for daily administration tasks and a SOAP interface for remote clients. (The entire functionality of the VOMS Admin service is accessible via the SOAP interface.) The Admin package includes a simple command\u00ad-line SOAP client that is useful for automating frequently occurring batch operations, or simply to serve as an alternative to the full blown web interface. It is also useful for bootstrapping the service. This VOMS server uses MySQL as a backend.","releaseDate":"2011-07-11 20:50:50","majorVersion":2,"minorVersion":0,"revisionVersion":0,"releaseNotes":"\n\n                           What's new:\n\n    * Voms packaging has been changed to install into system directories.
