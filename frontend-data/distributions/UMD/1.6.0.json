Currently only minimal information is made available, including the server version. In uvos-clc a new operation was added (getServerInfo) which can be used to query the server. Client documentation was updated to cover the new command.\n\n    New feature: For UVOS client and server web modules src.rpms are available.\n\n\n\nInstallation and configuration:\n\n    There were no changes in configuration files so the update should install without any problems. However it is advised (as always) to double check if there are any .rpmnew or .rpmsave files in the \/etc\/unicore\/uvos\/uvos-server and \/etc\/unicore\/uvos\/uvos-clc directories.\n\n\n\nKnown issues\n\n    None\n\n                          ","knownIssues":null,"changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","additionalDetails":null,"installationNotes":null,"keywords":"[]","apicallback":null,"documentationLinks":"{\"documentationLink\":{\"link\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.eu-emi.eu\\\/kebnekaise-products\\\/-\\\/asset_publisher\\\/4BKc\\\/content\\\/uvos?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-emi.eu%2Fkebnekaise-products%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_4BKc%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_pos%3D1%26p_p_col_count%3D2\",\"type\":\"other\"}}","capabilities":["Attribute Authority"],"capability":"Attribute Authority","targets":[{"id":114,"productId":135,"platform":"sl5","arch":"x86_64","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1\/sl5\/x86_64\/updates","gpgkey":null,"rpms":null,"apicallback":"http:\/\/admin-repo.egi.eu\/api\/report\/release\/xml?id=3189","status":1}],"softwareConfigurationLink":null,"distributionId":10,"productId":135,"status":1},{"id":75,"name":"emi.unicore-xuudb","productName":"UNICORE XUUDB","version":"1.3.3","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":3,"revisionVersion":3,"distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"1.6.0","description":"The XUUDB server is Attribute Source implementation which can be used by UNICORE servers.
