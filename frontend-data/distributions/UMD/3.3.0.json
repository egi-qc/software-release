The resource level BDII is usually co-located with the grid service and provides information about that service. Each grid site runs a site level BDII. This aggregates the information from all the resource level BDIIs running at that site. The top level BDII aggregates all the information from all the site level BDIIs and hence contains information about all grid services. There are multiple instances of the top level BDII in order to provide a fault tolerant, load balanced service.

It offers a simple way to create a disk-based grid storage element and supports relevant protocols (SRM, gridFTP, RFIO) for file management and access. It focus on manageability (ease of installation, configuration, low effort of maintenance), while providing all required functionality for a grid storage solution (support for multiple disk server nodes, different space types, multiple file replicas in disk pools).\n\n      ","currentState":"deployed","contact":"cristina.aiftimiei@pd.infn.it","technicalContact":"cristina.aiftimiei@pd.infn.it","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","technologyProvider":"EPEL","technologyProviderShortName":"EPEL","releaseDate":"2013-12-13 16:02:12","lastUpdated":"2013-12-13 16:02:12","releaseNotes":"\n\n          https:\/\/svnweb.cern.ch\/trac\/lcgdm\/attachment\/wiki\/Dpm\/dpmrelnotes_082013-1.txt\n\n      ","knownIssues":null,"changeLog":"\n\n          Move to EPEL repository for most of the packages\n\n      ","additionalDetails":null,"installationNotes":null,"keywords":"[]","apicallback":null,"documentationLinks":"{\"documentationLink\":{\"link\":\"https:\\\/\\\/svnweb.cern.ch\\\/trac\\\/lcgdm\\\/wiki\\\/Dpm\",\"type\":\"other\"}}","capabilities":[],"capability":null,"targets":[],"softwareConfigurationLink":null,"distributionId":58,"productId":501,"status":1},{"id":441,"name":"epel.emi-ui","productName":"emi-ui","version":"3.0.3","majorVersion":3,"minorVersion":0,"revisionVersion":3,"distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.3.0","description":"emi-ui epel dependencies","currentState":"deployed","contact":"christian.bernardt@desy.de","technicalContact":"christian.bernardt@desy.de","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","technologyProvider":"EPEL","technologyProviderShortName":"EPEL","releaseDate":"2013-12-13 16:02:12","lastUpdated":"2013-12-13 16:02:12","releaseNotes":"emi-ui epel dependencies","knownIssues":null,"changeLog":"emi-ui epel dependencies","additionalDetails":null,"installationNotes":null,"keywords":"[]","apicallback":null,"documentationLinks":"{\"documentationLink\":{\"link\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.eu-emi.eu\\\/releases\\\/emi-3-monte-bianco\\\/updates\\\/-\\\/asset_publisher\\\/5Na8\\\/content\\\/update-9-07-10-2013-v-3-5-2-1#UI_v_3_0_3\",\"type\":\"other\"}}","capabilities":["Client Tools"],"capability":"Client Tools","targets":[],"softwareConfigurationLink":null,"distributionId":58,"productId":502,"status":1},{"id":442,"name":"epel.gfal-lcg_util","productName":"GFAL\/lcg_util","version":"1.16.0","majorVersion":1,"minorVersion":16,"revisionVersion":0,"distributionType":"UMD","distributionVersion":"3.3.0","description":"\n\n      The Grid File Access Library (GFAL) is a library that offers to the user a POSIX-like interface to access data on various flavours of Storage Elements offering an SRM interface. GFAL is interfaced to SRM-compliant back-ends (both v1.1 and v2.2) and storage systems such as Castor, dCache or DPM in which case the relevant protocol is used transparently behind the scenes. Using information published in the information system, it resolves relevant abstract domain data\/file names so that the physical data access as well as the end-points of services are achievable transparently. It allows and unifies access to various types of items such as: LFN, GUID, SURL, SRM and TURL or local path. In addition, some of the crucial, yet common, backend calls are exposed through the library so that users are not limited to POSIX mapping to do specific calls e.g. to reserve space or pin a file. The pluggable architecture of the library permits dynamic change of the versions of some of the supported protocols (i.e. rfio, dCache) without need of redeployment.\n\n      ","currentState":"deployed","contact":"alejandro.alvarez.ayllon@cern.ch","technicalContact":"alejandro.alvarez.ayllon@cern.ch","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/3","technologyProvider":"EPEL","technologyProviderShortName":"EPEL","releaseDate":"2013-12-13 16:02:12","lastUpdated":"2013-12-13 16:02:12","releaseNotes":"\n\n          This is the last release of gfal \/ lcg-util including new functionality.
