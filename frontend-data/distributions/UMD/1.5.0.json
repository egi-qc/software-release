\n\nDeployment notes:\n\n    emi-lb metapackage is installed by yum.\n\n    yaim configuration requires, at the very least, setting MYSQL_PASSWORD, SITE_NAME and SITE_EMAIL in the site-info.def

It (package emi-lb-nagios-plugins) can be installed separately.\n\n \n\nKnown Issues:\n\n    Due to faulty DNS over IPv6 resolution in the c-ares library (v. 1.6.0), L&B does not work in most scenarios involving IPv6-only machines. Upgrade c-ares to 1.7.3 and relaunch yaim to get full IPv6 functionality.\n\n    Background purge works and return code is handled correctly. It also results in a clean termination of a slave, though, which is currently reported by the master to syslog with priority 'Error' despite being harmless (The actual wording is 'Slave \\d exited with return code 1').

In case of co-location with the L&B, make sure that yaim is run also for the latter.\n\n\n\n    In case of update, before applying the update stop all the services. After the update (after yum update and after yaim configuration):\n\n        set the ownership of the directories \/var and \/var\/log to root.root\n\n        execute the cron job \/etc\/cron.d\/glite-wms-create-host-proxy.cron \n\n    In case of a clean install, after yaim configuration:\n\n        execute the cron job \/etc\/cron.d\/glite-wms-create-host-proxy.cron \n\n\n\n    In the configuration file \/etc\/glite-wms\/glite_wms.conf the following two parametes for the load_monitor must always have the same values, even if different from the default ones: \n\n\n\njobSubmit  = \"${WMS_LOCATION_SBIN}\/glite_wms_wmproxy_load_monitor --oper jobSubmit --load1 22 --load5 20 --load15 18 --memusage 99 --diskusage 95 --fdnum 1000 --jdnum 150000  --ftpconn 300\";\n\njobRegister  =  \"${WMS_LOCATION_SBIN}\/glite_wms_wmproxy_load_monitor --oper jobRegister --load1 22 --load5 20 --load15 18 --memusage 99 --diskusage 95 --fdnum 1000 --jdnum 150000 --ftpconn 300\";\n\n\n\nThe admin guide has been updated with the following information:\n\n    The location of the drain file has changed with respect to the gLite version\n\n    Configuration tips in case colocation with the LB \n\n\n\nCheck out the guide for more details.\n\n\n\nKnown issues\n\nAs said above, this update fixes a problem on ext3 with the proxy purger preventing new delegations for a certain user after her 31999th submission. Even with this fix, there are at any rate some minor issues on ext3:\n\n    a: there can be at most 31999 different users submitting to a certain WMS (very unlikely)\n\n    b: there can be at most 31999 valid (i.e. not expired) proxies for a certain user (the purging of the expired proxy files is done on the WMS by a cron job which runs every 6 hours) \n\n\n\nTo definitely avoid this issues, ext4 is needed. Nonetheless, re-creating new delegations each time without reusing them has to be considered a bad and not supported practice, so that what mentioned here only for the sake of clarity should be actually considered a non-issue more than a known issue.\n\n    In case of WMS+LB colocation, error \"no state in DB\" on glite-wms-job-submit means that the WMS has not been authorized in the L&B authorization file. Refer to the 'Installation and configuration\" section above to fix this issue.\n\n    If there are problems with purging, or the first output retrieval gives \"Warning - JobPurging not allowed (CA certificate verification failed)\", that means that the host proxy certificate has not been installed. Refer to the \"Installation and configuration\" section above to fix this issue. \n\nOn very high loads, kind of submitting 1k\/2k collections of 25 nodes with a frequency of 60 seconds, the following call to the L&B might require a not trivial time (wmproxy.log):\n\n\"WMPEventlogger::registerSubJobs\": Registering DAG subjobs to LB Proxy..\n\nIf this time is long enough to exceed the mod_fcgid IPCCommTimeout parameter, then the request will be terminated with the consequence of leaving the collection pending forever. Other than increasing IPCCommTimeout, check that L&B is properly doing its purging. Especially when in 'both' mode, the admin can act on the purging policy to make it more frequent. In proxy mode, the admin can eventually decide to turn off automatic purging of the jobs in terminal state (-G option of glite-lb-bkserverd).\n\n    The \"job feedback\", a newly introduced feature to replan jobs stuck at blocking queues, is far from being perfect, at this stage. Its use is encouraged to give us 'feedback'. The feedback is a mechanism that relies on the existence of a global synchronization token, so requiring the shallow resubmission feature enabled. For this reason, it must not be used with the deep resubmission enabled. \n\n                          ","knownIssues":null,"changeLog":"\n\n                          Put the Change logs here (multiline field)\n\n                          ","additionalDetails":null,"installationNotes":null,"keywords":"[]","apicallback":null,"documentationLinks":"{\"documentationLink\":{\"link\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.eu-emi.eu\\\/emi-1-kebnekaise-updates\\\/-\\\/asset_publisher\\\/Ir6q\\\/content\\\/update-11-15-12-2011\",\"type\":\"other\"}}","capabilities":["Job Scheduling"],"capability":"Job Scheduling","targets":[{"id":106,"productId":127,"platform":"sl5","arch":"x86_64","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1\/sl5\/x86_64\/updates","gpgkey":null,"rpms":null,"apicallback":"http:\/\/admin-repo.egi.eu\/api\/report\/release\/xml?id=3256","status":1}],"softwareConfigurationLink":null,"distributionId":8,"productId":127,"status":1}]}
