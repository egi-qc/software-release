In the WMS, the scope of tasks needs to be broadened to take into account other kinds of resources, such as storage or network capacity. This change of definition is mainly due to the move from batch-like activity to applications with more demanding requirements in areas like data access or interactivity, both with the user and with other tasks. The WMS will broaden its scope accordingly.","currentState":"deployed","contact":"cristina.aiftimiei@pd.infn.it","technicalContact":"cristina.aiftimiei@pd.infn.it","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1","technologyProvider":"European Middleware Initiative","technologyProviderShortName":"EMI","releaseDate":"2012-07-23 10:15:14","lastUpdated":"2012-07-23 10:15:14","releaseNotes":"http:\/\/www.eu-emi.eu\/emi-1-kebnekaise-updates\/-\/asset_publisher\/Ir6q\/content\/update-16-12-07-2012","knownIssues":null,"changeLog":"This release is meant to address a vulnerability in the WMS, assessed by the SVG: SVG:Advisory-SVG-2012-4039.","additionalDetails":null,"installationNotes":null,"keywords":"[]","apicallback":null,"documentationLinks":"{\"documentationLink\":{\"link\":\"http:\\\/\\\/web.infn.it\\\/gLiteWMS\\\/index.php\\\/techdoc\\\/howtosandguides\\\/57-archoverview\",\"type\":\"other\"}}","capabilities":["Job Scheduling"],"capability":"Job Scheduling","targets":[{"id":136,"productId":157,"platform":"sl5","arch":"x86_64","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/1\/sl5\/x86_64\/updates","gpgkey":null,"rpms":null,"apicallback":"http:\/\/admin-repo.egi.eu\/api\/report\/release\/xml?id=4069","status":1}],"softwareConfigurationLink":null,"distributionId":12,"productId":157,"status":1}]}
