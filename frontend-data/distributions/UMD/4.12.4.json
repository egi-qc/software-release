Another important characteristic of StoRM is the capability to identify the physical location of a requested data without querying any database service but evaluating a configuration file, an XML schema that describes the storage namespace and input parameters as the logical identifier and SRM attributes. StoRM relies on the underlying file system structure to identify the physical data position.\n","currentState":"deployed","contact":"andrea.ceccanti@cnaf.infn.it","technicalContact":"andrea.ceccanti@cnaf.infn.it","repositoryURL":"sw\/production\/umd\/4","technologyProvider":"INFN","technologyProviderShortName":"INFN","releaseDate":"2020-11-20 11:06:01","lastUpdated":"2020-11-20 11:06:01","releaseNotes":"http:\/\/italiangrid.github.io\/storm\/2020\/10\/29\/storm-v1.11.19-released.html","knownIssues":null,"changeLog":"http:\/\/italiangrid.github.io\/storm\/2020\/10\/29\/storm-v1.11.19-released.html","additionalDetails":null,"installationNotes":null,"keywords":"[]","apicallback":null,"documentationLinks":"{\"documentationLink\":{\"link\":\"http:\\\/\\\/italiangrid.github.io\\\/storm\\\/documentation.html\",\"type\":\"other\"}}","capabilities":["File Access"],"capability":"File Access","targets":[],"softwareConfigurationLink":null,"distributionId":82,"productId":689,"status":1}]}
