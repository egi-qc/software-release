The dracut-fips package is not part of UMD, but it can come installed with the base system, although it is not often the case. The UMD team recommends to remove the dracut-fips package if not needed by the base system, right before upgrading to canL 2.1.7. In case you need dracut-fips instead, please contact the EGI Software Provisioning SU through GGUS to get support to resolve the conflict.","additionalDetails":"https:\/\/wiki.egi.eu\/wiki\/UMD-4:UMD-4.2.1","installationNotes":"All products in UMD 4.2.1 were verified against EGI's current Quality Criteria.
