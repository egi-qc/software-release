    "description" : "CernVM File System (CernVM-FS) is a network file system based on HTTP and optimized to deliver experiment software in a fast, scalable, and reliable way. Files and file metadata are aggressively cached and downloaded on demand. Thereby the CernVM-FS decouples the life cycle management of the application software releases from the operating system. CernVM-FS is included in CernVM, however it can also be used outside CernVM",
